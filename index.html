    <p>Chattogram is a financial center and a major coastal city in Southeastern Bangladesh. It is situated on the banks of the River Karnaphuli between the Bay of Bengal and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
        Chattogram is a wonderland for visitors looking for a digital detox from the fast-paced city life. On one side, you can see breathtaking mountain ranges overlooking the sea, and on the other is 
        the vast ocean's tranquil water. Due to its geographical position, sea, lush greenery, and mountain, there is no other city in Bangladesh that offers similar geodiversity.<br>
        
        If you're looking for the best places to visit during your Chattogram, you must head to Patenga Beach, where you can soak the sun and enjoy picturesque views. You should also visit
        Chandranath Hill & Temple, a popular pilgrimage site, and explore Rangamati, a hilly district. Some of the best things that you can try during your Chattogram tour are enjoying a scenic
        walk in Sajek Valley and boating at Kaptai Lake. You can also hike up to Nilgiri Mountain and enjoy shopping at Cox's Bazar.</p>
